# 🛡️ Task 5 – Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark  

## 📌 Objective  
The goal of this task is to **capture live network packets** using Wireshark and identify basic protocols and traffic types.  
This helps in developing **hands-on packet analysis skills** and increases **protocol awareness**.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) (free, open-source network protocol analyzer)  

---

## 📋 Steps Performed  

1. **Installed Wireshark** on the system.  
2. **Started capturing packets** on the active network interface.  
3. Generated network traffic by browsing websites and pinging servers.  
4. **Stopped the capture** after ~1 minute.  
5. Applied **filters** to view packets by protocol (HTTP, DNS, TCP, etc.).  
6. Identified at least **3 different protocols** in the capture.  
7. Exported the capture as a **`.pcap` file**.  
8. Summarized findings with protocol details.  

---

## 🔍 Findings  

During analysis, the following protocols were identified in the captured traffic:  

- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Used for translating domain names into IP addresses.  
- **ICMP:** network layer protocol used by network devices to diagnose network communication issues.  
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Ensures reliable communication between devices.

## 📂 Deliverables  

- **Packet Capture File:** `capture.pcap`  
- **Report:** This README file documenting protocols and findings.
