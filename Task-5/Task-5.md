## Task-5 Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark.

1. What is a Wireshark?
 - Wireshark is a free, open-source network protocol analyzer that captures and inspects real-time   network traffic, allowing users to see data packets at a microscopic level to troubleshoot network  issues, analyze performance, and detect security vulnerabilities

2. Start capturing on your active network interface.
 - To start capturing a network open wireshark and select eth0 or wifi whatever interface you are in and it automatically starts to capture.

3. Browse a website or ping a server to generate traffic.
 - Ping command is a network utility that tests network connectivity by sending small packets (ICMP    Echo Requests) to a destination IP address or domain name and measures the time it takes for the "echo" or response to come back.
  It can be done on terminal.

4. Filter captured packets by protocol (e.g., HTTP, DNS, TCP).
 - To filter a captured packets in wireshark go to search panel on the above and search for the        protocol.

5. Identify at least 3 different protocols in the capture.
 - During my analysis protocols that I captured are 1.ARP 2.TLS 3.ICMP

6. Export the capture as a .pcap file.
 - To export it as pcap file goto file> save as and save it with the name.




## Outcome: Hands-on packet analysis skills and protocol awareness.
