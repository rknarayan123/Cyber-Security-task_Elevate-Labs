# 🔐 Task 6: Password Strength & Security  

## 📌 Objective  
The goal of this task was to **understand what makes a password strong** and test different passwords against strength-checking tools. This helps in learning how complexity and length impact resistance to attacks like brute force and dictionary attacks.  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Password Strength Checkers** (e.g., [passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com))  
- Online resources for researching password attacks and best practices  

---

## 📖 Steps Followed  
1. Created multiple passwords with different complexity levels:  
   - Simple (only lowercase letters)  
   - Moderate (mixed case + numbers)  
   - Strong (mixed case + numbers + special characters + longer length)  

2. Tested each password on password strength checkers.  

3. Recorded scores and feedback from the tool.  

4. Researched common attacks such as:  
   - **Brute Force Attack** – tries all possible combinations.  
   - **Dictionary Attack** – uses common words or leaked password lists.  

5. Identified best practices for creating secure passwords.

## ✅ Key Learnings  
- **Password length matters**: longer = harder to crack.  
- **Complexity boosts strength**: mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols increases resistance.  
- **Avoid common words & patterns**: they are easily targeted in dictionary attacks.  
- **Passphrases** (like `PurpleDuck$RunsFast2025!`) are strong and easy to remember.  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** adds another layer of protection beyond passwords.  
- **Password Managers** help create and store strong unique passwords without relying on memory.

## 🔎 Example Results  
| Password Example       | Strength Tool Score | Feedback                                |
|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `hello123`             | Weak                 | Too short, common word, predictable     |
| `HelloWorld2024`       | Medium               | Better length, but lacks symbols        |
| `H@rd2Gu3ss!2024#`     | Strong               | Excellent mix of characters + length    |
