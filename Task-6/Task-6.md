## Task 6 : Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength.

1. Why is strong password important?
 - Strong passwords are vital to protect your accounts, devices, and personal information from unauthorized access by hackers and   cybercriminals. Weak passwords are easy to guess and can lead to stolen identities, financial loss, and other forms of cybercrime.

2. Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and length variations.
 Asdfgh123@
 qiohdvnow1238!@$$
 cbbvm12!#%^&*(*&^
 123456
 abcd123

3. Test each password on password strength checker.
  - each password has been checked and screenshot is attached.

4. Identify best practices for creating strong passwords.
  Best practices for creating strong passwords..
   - Longer passwords are more secure than shorter ones. Aim for at least 12 to 16 characters.
       ðŸ”’ 6 character password example: P@ssw* -- Time To Crack: 6 Seconds.
       ðŸ”’ 8 character password example: P@ssw*rd -- Time To Crack: 8 Minutes
       ðŸ”’ 12 character password example: LongP@ssw*rd -- Time To Crack: 3 Days.
       ðŸ”’ 16 character password example: LongP@ssw*rd*#*^ -- Time To Crack: 75 Years.

   - Padding involves the strategic addition of seemingly random characters to your password to increase its length and complexity,     making it harder for attackers to crack. This method is especially effective when the added characters include symbols or a mix of symbols and numbers. It can easily transform an average password into an excellent password. 

   - Avoid common words and phrases.
   - Use a Mixture Of Characters.
   - Avoid Sequential Or Repeated Characters. 

5. Research common password attacks (brute force, dictionary).
- Brute Force Attack 
 How it works:
    This attack uses automated software to systematically test every possible combination of characters, numbers, and symbols until the correct password is found.
 Example:
    For a four-digit PIN (0000-9999), a brute force attack would test all 10,000 possibilities until it finds the correct one.
Effectiveness:
    Very effective against weak and short passwords but becomes extremely time-consuming for longer, more complex passwords.
- Dictionary Attack
 How it works:
    This is a type of brute force attack that uses a predefined "dictionary" of common words, phrases, and potentially password patterns. 
Variations:
    Attackers often enhance these words with numbers, symbols, or letter substitutions (e.g., "p@ssword" instead of "password"). 
 Effectiveness:
    Highly effective because many users choose common words or variations as their passwords. 
- Hybrid Attack:
    Combines dictionary and brute force methods by starting with a dictionary of words and then adding random numbers or characters to them, like "NewYork1993". 
- Credential Stuffing:
    Uses credentials (usernames and passwords) stolen from one data breach to try and gain access to other accounts, exploiting password reuse.

6. Summarize how password complexity affects security.
  Password complexity increases security primarily by making it significantly harder for hackers to guess or crack passwords through automated attacks. 
  By requiring a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, complexity rules prevent users from choosing common dictionary words or easily guessed phrases (e.g., "password123"). This forces attackers to abandon simple dictionary attacks for slower, more resource-intensive methods.
