## ‚ùì Interview Questions and Answers

**1. What is a VPN?**  
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that encrypts internet traffic and routes it through a secure server, hiding the user‚Äôs IP address and improving online privacy.

**2. How does a VPN protect privacy?**  
By creating an encrypted tunnel between the device and the VPN server, preventing ISPs, hackers, or third parties from monitoring browsing activity.

**3. Difference between VPN and Proxy**  
- **VPN:** Encrypts all traffic across the device and provides full protection.  
- **Proxy:** Routes only specific app/browser traffic, often without encryption.

**4. What is encryption in VPNs?**  
Encryption converts readable data into ciphertext using cryptographic algorithms like AES-256, ensuring confidentiality of transmitted data.

**5. Can VPNs guarantee complete anonymity?**  
No. VPNs provide privacy, not full anonymity. Providers may log activity, and other tracking methods like cookies or browser fingerprints still apply.

**6. What are common VPN protocols?**  
OpenVPN, WireGuard, and IKEv2/IPSec ‚Äî balancing performance, security, and compatibility.

**7. What are the limitations of VPNs?**  
Reduced speed, potential provider data logging, server restrictions, and incompatibility with some websites or services.

**8. How does a VPN affect speed?**  
Due to encryption and routing overhead, VPNs may slightly reduce connection speed or increase latency depending on the server distance.
